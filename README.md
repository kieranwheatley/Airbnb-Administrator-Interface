# Airbnb Administrator Interface #
This software was created as my assignment piece for my SOFT152 - Software Engineering module in my first year of University.

## Application Overview ##
For this assignment we were looking at storing data in arrays that were within objects and how we could then manipulate the data set. The Airbnb dataset used contained Districts, Neighbourhoods, and Properties. There are multiple districts, each containing a certain amount of neighbourhoods, which each have a group of properties so they had to be stored in a specific way to ensure the relation was maintained. The GUI has, in my own opinion, been developed in a user-friendly manner which makes it clear to understand what can be done and when it can be completed.

## Application Features ##
* File Streams 
  * Reading from a file
  * Writing to a file
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Dynamic array length allocation
* User-friendly GUI
* Data manipulation
  * Create new District, Neighbourhood, Property
  * Edit/Update existing District, Neighbourhood, Property 
  * Delete any District, Neighbourhood, Property <br />
  `Changes made to any of the options will reflect within both higher and lower objects within`

## Please Note ##
When running the application, you __must__ choose the "Dataset for Application" text file included in the repo to when selecting a file otherwise the application __will not run__. The filepath has __not__ been hardcoded in as this was against the assignment brief.
